## 🎯 Introduction
A web-based or chatbot-powered AI assistant that provides incident resolution suggestions and executes predefined Ansible playbooks to automate troubleshooting. It integrates with GPT, LLaMA, or Gemini AI to analyze tickets and telemetry data while pulling relevant Knowledge Base articles and related incidents.

## 💡 Inspiration
Managing IT incidents manually is time-consuming and error-prone. We aimed to automate troubleshooting by integrating AI-powered analysis with predefined playbooks to suggest and execute fixes.

## ⚙️ What It Does
Accepts incident descriptions from users
Sends them to Gemini AI for analysis
Returns a  fix for resolution
Automates fixes using Ansible Playbooks
Integrates with ServiceNow, Jira, Confluence (planned)

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Frontend: Streamlit / React.js for a user-friendly interface
Backend: FastAPI / Flask for processing incidents
AI Models: OpenAI API, LLaMA, Gemini for analyzing incidents
Automation: Ansible Playbooks to apply fixes
Telemetry: OpenTelemetry, ElasticSearch for logs and monitoring
Infrastructure: Terraform for AWS deployment

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
Hackathon Restrictions: We could not integrate real banking APIs
AI Accuracy: Tuning AI models for better recommendations
Infrastructure Setup: Managing AWS resources with Terraform

## 🏃 How to Run
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Node.js (if using React frontend)
AWS account for cloud deployment
API keys for OpenAI/Gemini

Steps
  Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name

Set up Backend
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py

 Launch Frontend (Streamlit or React)
   cd frontend
   streamlit run app.py  # For Streamlit UI  
   npm install && npm start  # For React UI
   
Deploy to AWS using Terraform
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
